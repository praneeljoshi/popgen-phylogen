# pop-gen-vs-phylo
Code for the pop gen vs. phylo research project. 

We've built out a pipeline to automatically generate random admixture networks; generate multiple sequence aligment and biallelic marker data based on these networks; run GTmix, TreeMix, Structure, and PhyloNet on this data; and finally evaluate the results of each method by computing relevant statistics. 

## Python Dependencies
* `networkx`
* `dendropy`
* `newick` (not needed when using `parse_rich_newick2.py`, which is now the default)
* `pydot` (optional, needed to output PDFs)

These can all be installed easily with pip (or pip3, depending on your Python installation): `pip install networkx dendropy newick pydot`.
